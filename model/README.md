### Fine tuning steps
* Run finetune_model.py with default configuration to generate QLORA adapters (takes few minutes with very minimal parameters configured by default).
* Sync the latest adapters from localhost with the huggingface repository (link: https://huggingface.co/tapopadma).
* Run inference_cli.sh for manual interaction with the latest version of the model.
